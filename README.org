#+begin_notes
Most slides will have some code, not all of it will be best practice, but
eventually we should get there.

As this talk is designed so everyone can get something out of it, if
you're unsure of something or don't understand please ask questions.
#+end_notes
** Goals
*** Increase your knowledge of RSpec
#+begin_notes
I don't want this to be taken as patronising, I believe one should never
stop learning. Even while preparing this talk I've learned a few
things myself which have already impacted the way I write specs.
#+end_notes
*** Increase your comfort level in RSpec
#+begin_notes
Just like any other tool, the more knowledgeable of something you are
the more comfortable you should be using it.
#+end_notes
*** Increase the reliability and readability of specs
#+begin_notes
RSpec is designed not just to be written, but also read. Following
best practices will help you write more readable specs which in turn
will make them more reliable and maintainable.

If you can understand what a spec should do, you should be able to
understand it.

As a rule of thumb, the documentation string should provide enough
context to know what the example is testing

Sometimes they can get pretty verbose, but that should be a sign that
there is a lot of context going into the example you're describing
#+end_notes
** How?
[[./assets/bikes.jpg]]
#+begin_notes
I'm taking a page out of Sandi Metz's book, take something everyone
should be familiar with and relating to a subject matter they may not
be familiar with.
#+end_notes
*** Explain the DSL
Start simple and build up
#+begin_notes
In this case we'll be looking at specs for a Bike and without looking
into how it's implemented I should be able thoroughly describe how a
Bike works.
#+end_notes
*** Explain the Friction and Pain
#+begin_notes
Generally either mean you're moving in a direction your tool doesn't want
you to.
#+end_notes
Bike time!
#+begin_notes
Imagine you're riding a bike and decide you want to stop. You grab the
tyre eventually coming to a stop, but not with nearly as much skin on
your hands as when you started. Sure it worked, but there are other
tools you can utilise to remove the pain and make your life easier.
#+end_notes
** What won't be covered (today)
*** Capybara
#+begin_notes
This is basically a separate DSL ontop of the RSpec DSL, I will be
covering this in a separate talk to give it the attention it deserves.
#+end_notes
*** Quantum Field Theory
#+begin_notes
Honestly I just don't time, but I'd love to chat about it
#+end_notes
* DSL
As RSpec is a DSL, generally everything you do utilise the DSL
#+begin_notes
This may seem an odd order to do things in, but I'd rather focus on as
few things at a time so that everything gets the attention it
deserves.

Throughout these examples we will be
#+end_notes
** let
#+begin_src ruby
let(:bike) { Bike.new }
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Let is one of the most basic concepts in RSpec, it is how you introduce
important variables to scope of what you're testing.
#+end_notes
*** let!
#+begin_src ruby
let!(:bike) { Bike.new }
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
let! is let but with a reference in an implicit before block, this
allows you to evaluate and memoise the value before any of your
example runs
#+end_notes
** subject
#+begin_src ruby
subject { bike.gear }
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Subject is used to communicate to the reader what is being tested.

Internally it's mostly just let(:subject)
#+end_notes
*** subject!
#+begin_src ruby
subject! { bike.gear }
#+end_src
*** named subject
#+begin_src ruby
subject(:shift_up) { bike.shift_up }
#+end_src
** describe
Convey what is being tested
#+begin_notes
Describe blocks convey what is being tested, whether that be a class
or a method.

Furthermore you should generally limit the depth of describe blocks to
two, one for your class and another for your method.
#+end_notes
*** class
#+begin_src ruby
describe Bike do
end
#+end_src
*** method
#+begin_src ruby
describe "#shift_up" do
  subject(:shift_up) { bike.shift_up }
  let(:bike) { described_class.new }
end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Method describe block names should reflect the method you're testing
#+end_notes
** context
#+begin_src ruby
context "when in highest gear" do
  let(:bike) { described_class.new(gear: Bike::MAX_GEAR) }
end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Context blocks provide context to the current example, generally here
is where you'll setup the state of the world you're testing
#+end_notes
*** Negative case
#+begin_src ruby
context "when not in the highest gear" do
  let(:bike) { described_class.new(gear: Bike::MIN_GEAR) }
end
#+end_src
** it
#+begin_src ruby
it "shifts up one gear" do
  expect { shift_up }.to change(bike, :gear).by(1)
end
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
Bike #shift_up when not in the highest gear shifts up one gear
#+end_quote
#+begin_notes
It blocks are the way you describe the behaviour, the most common form
is a multi-line it block with a description and a body with generally
one expectation.
#+end_notes
*** single line
#+begin_src ruby
it { expect { shift_up }.to change(bike, :gear).by(1) }
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
Bike #shift_up when not in the highest gear is expected to change `Bike#gear` by 1
#+end_quote
#+begin_notes
Sometimes it's easier and cleaner to use a single line expectation.
For this form you will omit the documentation string and sometimes
switch to using is_expected over expect(subject), this should only be
used when it makes the
#+end_notes
** specify
#+begin_src ruby
specify { expect { shift_up }.to change(bike, :gear).by(1) }
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
Bike #shift_up when not in the highest gear is expected to change `Bike#gear` by 1
#+end_quote
#+begin_notes
Specify's primary use is when creating an example without a dosctring,
and with multiple lines the last executed example will produce the
docstring
#+end_notes
*** specify with docstring
#+begin_src ruby
specify "when called multiple times is idempotent" do
  # ...
end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
The lesser used form with a docstring should only be used when a
docstring reads poorly with it, remember specs are going to be read
more often than written.

Generally I'd discourage the use of either, as they make the source
code arguably harder to read, but do have their place
#+end_notes
** TODO hooks
#+begin_src ruby
  before { bike.remove_chain }
  after { bike.install_chain }
  # or
  around do |example|
    bike.remove_chain
    example.call
    bike.install_chain
  end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Hooks allow you to setup the state of the world in a way which lets
won't let you do.

Most of your shared setup should go inside of before blocks
#+end_notes
** shared context
#+begin_src ruby
shared_context "in highest gear" do
  let(:bike) { described_class.new(gear: Bike::MAX_GEAR) }
end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Is their copy pasta inside your specs? Shared contexts are your saviour.
#+end_notes
** TODO shared examples
#+begin_notes
Ever seen iteration with an it block inside of it? This is what shared
examples are for. They allow you to abstract out the functionality to
code blocks which you can include.
#+end_notes
** should
You _should_ not use it
#+begin_notes
It's a big monkey patch which has since fallen out of favour with the
preference now being to use expect.
#+end_notes
* Take Aways
** Friction and Pain
Generally either mean you're moving in a direction your tool doesn't want
you to.
* Pro tips (by Tony Hawk)
Various things which generally can't be statically detected and rely
on the writer's experience
** Incidental State or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Block Expectations
#+begin_src ruby
# bad
it "shifts up one gear" do
  previous_gear = bike.gear
  shift_up
  # ...
  expect(bike.gear).to eq previous + 1
end

# good
it "shifts up one gear" do
  expect { shift_up }.to change(bike, :gear).by(1)
end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
By utilising block expectations we limit the scope in which we're
testing, which allows us to better understand exactly what is being
tested as well as isolates us from
#+end_notes
*** Raise error
#+begin_src ruby
context "when chain is disconnected" do
  include_conext "chain disconnected"

  it { expect { shift_up }.to raise_error /No chain/ }
end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
If you've seen block expectations before, this is likely where you've
seen them.

I find them mainly useful when working with external libraries that
utilise exceptions for control flow. Generally in code you own you
should avoid exceptions as control flow but occassionaly they do have
their place.
#+end_notes
*** Composing matchers
#+begin_src ruby
  describe "#remove_chain" do
    # ...
    context "when chain is attached" do
      include_context "chain is attached"

      specify do
        expect { remove_chain }.to change(bike, :chain_attached?)
                                     .from(true)
                                     .to(false)
      end
    end
  end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Now that we've seen a bit of composing, lets take a look at a more
composed example.

While this is a semi-contrived example it shows a way that you can add
additional conditions to your example without adding additional
expectations.

Imagine (all the people) a scenario where this example was given a
bike without the chain attached. If you hadn't used the combination of
from and to you would get a false positive if #remove_chain doesn't
raise an error when no chain is attached.
#+end_notes
*** TODO Yielding
#+begin_src ruby

#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Yielding matchers are indispensable when working with custom
containers or methods that help facilitate iteration.
#+end_notes
** So I lied
#+begin_src ruby
describe "#shift_up" do
  subject(:shift_up) { bike.shift_up }

  specify "when called multiple times increases the gear each time" do
    expect { shift_up }.to change(bike, :gear).by(1) # will pass
    expect { shift_up }.to change(bike, :gear).by(1) # will fail
  end
end
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
When testing the idempotency of something, if you're calling
a ~let~ (e.g. a named subject) you're getting a memoised value which
will give you a false sense of idempotency.
#+end_quote
*** Making it work
#+begin_src ruby
describe "#shift_up" do
  specify "when called multiple times changes gear each time" do
    expect { bike.shift_up }.to change(bike, :gear).by(1) # will pass
    expect { bike.shift_up }.to change(bike, :gear).by(1) # will also pass
  end
end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
In this case prefer calling a method on an object instead
#+end_notes
*** Clever use of game mechanics (exploits)
#+begin_src ruby
describe "#shift_up" do
  subject(:shift_up) { -> { bike.shift_up } }

  specify "when called multiple times changes gear each time" do
    is_expected.to change(bike, :gear).by(1) # will pass
    is_expected.to change(bike, :gear).by(1) # will also pass
  end
end
#+end_src
[[./assets/itjustworks.jpg]]
#+begin_notes
This used to be "supported" (read: clever use of game mechanics) with
implicit block expectations, however others don't seem so keen to
exploits ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
#+end_notes
** Multiple Expectations
#+begin_notes
This was actually something brought up when we added rubocop-rspec to
flatbook so I'd like to spend a bit discussing the theory. There are
two ways this can be handled inside of the specs and other ways you
can restructure your code to make them less desireable overall.
#+end_notes
*** Separate examples
#+begin_src ruby
it { is_expected.to start_with("WARNING:") }
it { is_expected.to end_with "!" }
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
1) warning is expected to start with "WARNING:"
   Failure/Error: it { is_expected.to start_with("WARNING:") }
     expected "WARN -- Something is messed up." to start with "WARNING:"

2) warning is expected to end with "!"
   Failure/Error: it { is_expected.to end_with "!" }
     expected "WARN -- Something is messed up." to end with "!"
#+end_quote
#+begin_notes
There are two main downsides to this approach, it increases the amount
of examples you run, and due to having to setup the context each time
increases the run time more than having them in the same example.

The main reason you'd choose this approach is that it's the convention
of rspec, i.e. single expectation per spec and usually you're going to
get more readable expectations
#+end_notes
*** Aggregate failures
#+begin_src ruby
it "passes our validations", aggregate_failures: true do
  expect(warning).to start_with("WARNING:")
  expect(warning).to end_with("!")
end
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
1) warning passes our validations
   Got 2 failures:

   1.1) Failure/Error: expect(warning).to start_with("WARNING:")
          expected "WARN -- Something is messed up." to start with "WARNING:"

   1.2) Failure/Error: expect(warning).to end_with("!")
          expected "WARN -- Something is messed up." to end with "!"
#+end_quote
#+begin_notes
#+end_notes
*** Compound expectations
#+begin_src ruby
it { is_expected.to start_with("WARNING:").and end_with("!") }
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
1) warning is expected to start with "WARNING:" and end with "!"
   Failure/Error: it { is_expected.to start_with("WARNING:").and end_with("!") }

        expected "WARN -- Something is messed up." to start with "WARNING:"

     ...and:

        expected "WARN -- Something is messed up." to end with "!"
#+end_quote
** Custom Matchers
#+begin_src ruby
RSpec::Matchers.define :be_a_warning do
  match do |actual|
    actual.start_with?("WARNING:") && actual.end_with?("!")
  end
end

it { is_expected.to be_a_warning }
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Following the previous multiple expectations for detecting a warning
here is how one could write a custom matcher to handle both of the
expectations.

Most complex expectations which have multiple "expectations" I would
geenerally write matchers for. This allows you to name what you're
expecting and provides greater flexability around
#+end_notes
*** TODO Complex Custom Matcher
#+begin_src ruby
RSpec::Matchers.define :be_bigger_than do |first|
  match do |actual|
    (actual > first) && (actual < @second)
  end

  chain :but_smaller_than do |second|
    @second = second
  end
end

describe 5 do
  it { should be_bigger_than(4).but_smaller_than(6) }
end

Various code snippets and ideas from [[https://rspec.rubystyle.guide/][rubocop rspec-style-guide]]
* Garbage
** More real world example                                             :cut:
#+begin_src ruby
# bad
it "publishes the article" do
  article.publish

  # Creating another shared Article test object above would cause this
  # test to break
  expect(Article.count).to eq(2)
end

# good
it "publishes the article" do
  expect { article.publish }.to change(Article, :count).by(1)
end
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
Honestly I couldn't put it better than rubocop's rspec style guide,
becoming comfortable with block expectations greatly increases your
ability to write readable and confident specs
#+end_notes
